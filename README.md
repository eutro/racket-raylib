## Installation

To install this package:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:eutro/racket-raylib.git
cd racket-raylib
raco pkg install
```

If you're on a common platform, then it should be enough to just
install this package without installing Raylib separately. However, if
you are not so lucky, you may need to [build and install Raylib
globally](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib#build-and-installation).
